## Project Overview

The **Suicide Prediction System** aims to identify individuals at risk of suicide through a comprehensive analysis of various factors. By analyzing socio-economic data, environmental influences, and mental health indicators, we can create a predictive model that helps in understanding the patterns and risks associated with suicide.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Suicide Prediction System, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MZ-STACKPY97/Suicide-Prediction-System.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Suicide-Prediction-System
   ```

3. **Download the latest release:**
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/MZ-STACKPY97/Suicide-Prediction-System/releases) section to download the latest version of the project files. Ensure you follow the instructions provided in the release notes.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes various datasets, including:

- National health surveys
- Socio-economic databases
- Environmental data from government agencies

These datasets provide a comprehensive view of the factors influencing mental health and suicide risk.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes essential libraries such as:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the main script to start the analysis:

```bash
python main.py
```

This script will load the datasets, perform data analysis, and generate predictions based on the machine learning models implemented.

## Features

- **Data Analysis:** Explore and analyze datasets to understand the relationships between various factors.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and evaluate different models to predict suicide risk.
- **Visualization:** Generate informative plots to visualize the data and results.

## Data Analysis

The data analysis phase involves several steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Use statistical methods and visualizations to uncover patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that can improve model performance.

We utilize libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and `seaborn` for visualization.

## Machine Learning Models

The project implements several machine learning models to predict suicide risk, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

Each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to determine its effectiveness.

## Visualization

Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the insights derived from the data. We use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create various plots, including:

- Histograms
- Box plots
- Heatmaps

These visualizations help in identifying trends and correlations among the factors affecting suicide risk.
